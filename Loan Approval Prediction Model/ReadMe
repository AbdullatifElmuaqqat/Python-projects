a supervised machine learning model in python to predict loan approvals using Gaussian Naive Bayes
and various strong libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. 

Description:
machine learning project that predicts loan approval status based on customer data.
The model trains %80 of the large database and test with the rest.
This model was built using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm and demonstrates how to 
preprocess data, train a classifier, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model for future use.
