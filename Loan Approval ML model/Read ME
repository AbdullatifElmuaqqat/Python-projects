Built a supervised machine learning model that predicts loan approval status based on customer data. 
The model uses Gaussian Naive Bayes along with Scikit-learn, Pandas, and various other machine learning 
libraries to support the training process. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building 
a predictive model, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Additionally, 
the project includes a random loan application generator that creates reports with as much data as the 
user wants, allowing for extensive database utilization in the training process.
