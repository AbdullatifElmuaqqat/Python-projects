This project is designed to predict whether an employee should be promoted based on
various factors such as age, years of experience, number of trainings attended, department, 
education level, gender, previous year rating, length of service, and number of projects handled. 
The prediction model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier from the scikit-learn library.

 Using a previously trained dataset, the model can predict the promotion status of any new data,
determining whether the employee deserves a promotion or not.
